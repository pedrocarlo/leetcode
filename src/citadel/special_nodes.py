"""
Let me explain this solution:

Finding Diameters: The key insight is that we can find a diameter of a tree using two BFS traversals:

Start BFS from any node to find the farthest node (end1)
Start another BFS from end1 to find the other end of the diameter (end2)
The path between end1 and end2 is one diameter of the tree


Finding All Special Nodes: However, we need to find ALL endpoints of ALL diameters, not just one. To do this:

For each endpoint of the first diameter we found (end1 and all nodes at distance = diameter_length from end2)
Run a BFS from each of these potential endpoints
Find all nodes that are at maximum distance from any of these endpoints
All such nodes are special nodes


Handling Multiple Diameters: The solution accounts for multiple diameters by checking nodes at maximum distance from each identified endpoint.

For example, with the input from Example 1:

We'll find that nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 are special as they're endpoints of diameters
All other nodes are not special

This solution has a time complexity of O(NÂ²) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because we might need to run BFS from multiple endpoints.
